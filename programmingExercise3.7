// Assignment: Interest on a credit card's unpaid balance is calculated using the average daily balance.
// Suppose that netBalance is the balance shown in the bill, payment is the payment made, d1 is the number of
// days in the billing cycle, and d2 is the number of days payment is made before billing cycle. 
// Then, the average daily balance is: averageDailyBalance = (netBalance * d1 - payment * d2) / d1
// If the interest rate per month is, say, 0.0152, then the interest on the unpaid balance is:
// interest = averageDailyBalance * interestRate
// Write a program that accepts as input, netBalance, d1, payment, d2, and interest rate per month (interestRate). 
// The program outputs the interest. 
// Format your output to two decimal places.
